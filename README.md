# Basic Usage

Run in a terminal:

```
python ga.py
```

### Extras:

 * You can experiment with the map generator to create different kind of maps.
 * You can assign different number of objective to test the TSP capabilities of the system. (This will probably take too long for high numbers of objectives)
 * You can (should) fork this repo!
